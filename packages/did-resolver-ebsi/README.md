  <br>EBSI Legal Entity DID resolver
  <br>
</h1>

This plugin supports EBSI v1 (Legal Entity) DIDs. Please note that for Natural Persons on EBSI you should use
our [did:key](../did-resolver-key) plugin. This resolver dos not support EBSI v2. Please be aware that v2 is not an
upgrade! v2 was an
interim and now defunct DID method for Natural Persons. EBSI v1 is for Legal Entities and did:key is for Natural
Persons. As a consequence we decided not to implement the v2 version.
